    name: 'Leaning Tower of Pisa',
    description: 'This iconic tilting bell tower stands 56 meters tall and leans at approximately 4 degrees. Construction began in 1173 and took nearly 200 years to complete. The lean resulted from an inadequate foundation on soft ground. By 1990, it reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees before restoration work reduced it to 3.97 degrees. Despite numerous attempts to correct its tilt throughout history, the tower\'s imperfection has become its most famous feature, attracting millions of visitors annually.',
